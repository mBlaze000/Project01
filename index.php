        <h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
      <p class="lead">I am a freelance video professional. I started making short films in grade school and have been <a href="http://youtu.be/WkKYyxCZ8QU">producing and editing video</a> my entire career. Secondarily, I have been a web designer and developer either internally with different companies or as a consultant.</p>
        <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
      <p class="lead">After working as a web designer for different corporations, I thought it might be time to get some formal training. Most of what I know about web design and development is from trial and error. I'm hoping that a formal background will give me a much deeper understanding of the technology and processes.
        <h2>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
      <p class="lead">I have been doing front-end web design for corporations on and off, for almost 20 years. 
        <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
      <p class="lead">I ran a small multimedia company for a few years and in that time was doing a lot of interactive CD-ROM development. This meant programming in a language called Lingo for development in Adobe (Macromedia) Director and ActionScript in Flash. I have done some tinkering in Classic ASP as well.</p>
        <h2>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h2>
      <p class="lead">The first course I took at the Harvard Extension School was <strong>CSCI E-12: Fundamentals of Website Development</strong>. In that class we did some work in PHP. This was my first hands-on exposure to PHP. It reminded me a little of Classic ASP. In the class we used PHP includes and basic variables. For my final project, I wrote some PHP code to determine the root of the website and generate a popcorn trail with links relative to the root.</p>
        <h2>Describe your level of experience with programming.</h2>
      <p class="lead">In college I took a class in PASCAL and enjoyed it. I have done some type of programming ever since.</p>
        <h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
      <p class="lead">I am currently working on a Mac computer.</p>
        <h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
      <p class="lead">I write a weekly blog on <a href="http://blog.dvfanatics.com">video production</a> and I have a great Golden Retriever named Max.</p>
