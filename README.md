# Project 1 - System Setup

## Live URL
<http://www.burkeweb.com/cscis15/project01/>
I'm still trying to get Pogodabox running. This initial URL is a web server I have access to.

## Description
An HTML document that contains a little more information about me.

## Details for teaching team
I'm using the Bootstrap framework for styling of the page. Currently I'm having issues with Pagodabox getting stuck in transaction every time I try to create an application. I have used a different hosting company until I can get it sorted out.

## Outside code
* Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/
* Bootstrap Theme: http://getbootstrap.com/examples/starter-template/
